javax.portlet.title.com_liferay_sales_checklist_DemoChecklistPortlet=DemoChecklist
message-analytics-cloud=Analytics Cloud connection looks ok, or it doesn't exist. But this feature hasn't been tested yet, it might be completely wrong. Better check manually yourself.
message-index=It looks like this instance has a working full text index. Found {0} user(s) in index and {1} in database.
message-login-prepopulate=The login dialog's user name is not pre-filled with a domain name (or you're not authenticating by email). An empty field helps Password Managers to fill in data for you.
message-password-policy-change-required=The default password policy allows administrators to change passwords without requiring the users to reset them again upon their first login. That's an appropriate Demo Security Level for Ease of Use.
message-redirection=Redirection to current host name {0} is allowed. Great.
message-session-extension=The session is extended as long as the browser is open - great for demos
message-strangers-can-create-accounts=Anonymous users can't create accounts on their own. Typically the expected situation in a demo.
message-updated-version-available=This plugin seems to run in its latest version {0} or newer, or you've disabled the upgrade check. The plugin assumes that it's in version {1} currently
message-virtualhost=This instance is accessed with its known virtual host name {1}. Good
missing-analytics-cloud=Analytics Cloud connection does not look good due to {0}. But note: This checklist-feature hasn't been properly tested yet, this alarm could be a false-positive.
missing-failed-checklist-item=One of the Checklist items couldn't be retrieved due to {0}
missing-index=This instance looks like it's lacking a complete full text index (There's no index in DXPC's backup). Found {0} users in index, {1} in DB.
missing-login-prepopulate=The login-dialog's user name is pre-filled with a domain name and you're identifying with email address. Bad for using Password Managers. See portal.properties entry {0} or authenticate by screen name.
missing-password-policy-change-required=The default password policy requires users to set a new password once an administrator has changed it. In demos, this is an extra step, and typically an administrator is impersonating the users anyway.
missing-redirection=Redirection to current host name {0} is not allowed (consider switching redirection mode to "domain" and allow the current host name)
missing-session-extension=It looks like the session times out... See portal.properties entry {0}
missing-strangers-can-create-accounts=It looks like anonymous users can create an account for themselves. Check portal.properties entry {0} or Instance Settings
missing-updated-version-available=A <a href="https://github.com/olafk/demo-checklist-web/releases/" target="_blank">newer version {0} of this checklist plugin</a> is available. This plugin is currently checking for anything newer than {1}, you can either update this configuration value to disable the check or upgrade
missing-virtualhost=This instance is accessed as {0}, but configured as {1} - consider changing the virtual host name
